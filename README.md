üçû Bakery Management System

üìú Project Overview


The Bakery Management System is a containerized multi-service application designed to manage bakery products, orders, and order statuses.
It showcases Docker containerization, service orchestration, networking, and inter-service communication using PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, a backend API service, and a worker service.





üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture
                          
Frontend: User interface to browse products and place orders.

Backend API: Serves APIs for product listing, order placement, and order tracking.

Worker Service: Processes orders asynchronously by consuming messages from RabbitMQ.

PostgreSQL: Stores products and orders.

RabbitMQ: Message broker for decoupling order placement and order processing.

üöÄ Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Docker

Docker Compose

Installation Steps
Clone the repository


git clone <your-repo-link>
cd bakery-system

Build and run the containers:

docker-compose up --build

Access the services:

Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Backend API: http://localhost:8000

RabbitMQ Management UI (Optional): http://localhost:15672
(Username: bakery, Password: bakery123)

To stop the services:
docker-compose down

üß© API Documentation

  }

2. Place an Order
Endpoint: POST /order

Description: Place a new order.

Request Body:


{

  "order_id": 101
}
3. Check Order Status
Endpoint: GET /order/:id

Description: Check the status of an order.

Response:


{
  "order_id": 101,
  "status": "Completed"
}

‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Features Implemented
Separate Backend API and Worker Containers:

backend/app.py (API Server) ‚Üí Dockerfile.app

backend/worker.py (Worker Service) ‚Üí Dockerfile.worker

Health Checks:

Docker Compose monitors PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and the backend API using container health checks to improve resilience.

Asynchronous Order Processing:

Orders are processed in the background using a worker service, ensuring fast frontend responsiveness.

RabbitMQ for Decoupling:

Loose coupling between order placement and order processing for better scalability.

Simple Lightweight Frontend:

Minimalistic frontend for quick browsing and order placement without frontend frameworks.
